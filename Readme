# URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener web application. The frontend is created with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The backend is powered by Flask and SQLAlchemy, and it uses a SQLite database to store URL mappings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Virtualenv (optional)

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   On Windows:
   ```
   .\myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   On Unix or MacOS:
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```
   python backend.py
   ```

   If the application starts successfully, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```
   * Serving Flask app 'backend'
   * Debug mode: on
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the frontend.

## Testing

To test the URL shortener:

1. Enter a URL in the text field.
2. Click the "Shorten" button.
3. The application will display a shortened URL. Click the "Copy" button to copy it to your clipboard.
4. Paste the shortened URL into your browser's address bar and press enter. You should be redirected to the original URL.

If you encounter any issues, check the console log in your browser (right-click -> Inspect -> Console) and the output of your Flask server for any error messages.
